# Start Finishing: Charlie Gilkey

# Part 1: Clearing the decks for your best work

## Chapter 1: Someday can be today

### You know you're not working on what matters most

We all have things we are not getting to. Things we feel we should do, or that we want to do.

Project: anything that takes time, energy, and attention to complete.

Everything is a project, but many people fill their lives with projects that don’t matter much to them and avoid doing the projects that do matter to them.

We have to convert our ideas into projects and be real about the projects we are doing.

### We thrive by doing our ‘Best Work’

We thrive by doing.

The work that leads to thriving can be described as our best work.

Work can be what makes us come alive and feel joyful.

The kind of work that feels like we get to do it, rather than have to do it, is our best work.

Everyone can and should do work uniquely them.

Your best work will serve you and others.

It is often hard, uncertain, on the edge, and faces opinion from others.

Other things often get in the way.

Your best work may not be your employment, but that still doesn’t make it less meaningful.

It’s not “how will it support your livelihood”, but “how it fits into a meaningful life.”

### We live in a project world

Everything is a project.

Projects come in different sizes.

Our lives can be thought of as a series of major projects lasting 3–5 years, containing a lot of smaller projects.

In the project world, we can embrace uncertainty while being intentional about which projects to embrace.

Whether we pick the right or wrong project, we can shift to another project when we complete a project we’re working on.

We don’t usually know where the project will take us when we start.

### Projects are mirrors and bridges

The push is to convert ideas into achievable projects that are followed through to completion.

Projects are mirrors of our current world and bridges to a better world.

Showing a specific piece of work to the world shows where our passions and fears lie.

Finishing a project is the single best way to build a bridge to the world we want to create.

### Embrace your “scattered” best work

We (creatives) are the kind of people that have varied and diverse interests.

We can choose to pursue multiple interests that are all at the core of who we are.

Embrace them all, but understand each requires upkeep and projects.

### How a philosopher-soldier turns into a productivity-teacher

Charlie Gilkey (author of this book) was studying philosophy when he was deployed to Iraq in the National Guard.

He did equipment deliveries, then became a battalion plans officer.

He returned to class and moved to pursue what it meant to thrive, be good to people, and build communities, societies, and institutions that lead to thriving.

He began researching solutions to meeting deadlines.

He found personal productivity too focused on the nitty gritty and tasks; personal development focused too much on principles or big ideas.

The problem was in the messy middle.

He applied his own approach and started sharing.

### The journey to finishing

This book divided into three parts:

General landscape of the world we work in and what’s in our heads.

How to make space for your project, how to convert it to a plan, and common obstacles.

How to get the plan on your schedule and work through the challenge of getting it done.

This is a distilled version of all the things Charlie has learned.

A lot of it is naming roadblocks so they can be more easily spotted.

You aren’t uniquely defective or fated to be unable to get yourself going.

We are more than the thoughts we have and actions we take—we can adopt new thoughts and take new actions to become the best version of ourselves.

You can rewrite the stories that stop you from being your best self.

You can be successful without burning out or being a hermit.

You deserve your best work, and the world will be better off for it to.

## Chapter 2: Getting to your best work

When you start trying to do your best work, it doesn’t take long before the challenges of normal life disrupt and take over.

It’s more than finding the motivation—you have to address parts of your life that are preventing you from doing it.

We need to address the gap between where you are now and being able to start finishing your important projects, and see how your ideas are unconsciously constrained by the way you are currently living.

### The air sandwich: Why your big picture and day-to-day reality don’t link up

This is a symbolic idea with the top slice being our vision, mission, purpose, and big goals, and the bottom slice being the realities of our real life.

But between these two slices are some things that challenge us:

Competing priorities

Head trash

No realistic plan

Too few resources

Poor team alignment

#### Competing priorities

We are often pulled in different directions to fulfil our desires.

Even if we elevate certain desires as priorities, they still compete.

Some of our priorities are unconscious, and we are not fully aware of them.

#### Head trash

We carry our own head trash (the stories we tell ourselves), based on personal experiences, histories, and contexts.

Head trash often comes from childhood and adulthood; it creates doubts and roadblocks.

Often absurd, it’s power is in being unchallenged.

#### No realistic plan

Some people have a plan, but it’s not realistic.

Some have no plan at all.

Some confuse aspiration or an idea for a plan.

You need to connect big ideas to day-to-day reality.

#### Too few resources

People don’t do stuff because they think they don’t have what they need.

Often, we don’t see how we can get those resources because we’re not open to looking.

Don’t let what you don’t have stop you from doing what you can do.

#### Poor Team Alignment

If you don’t have a good, supportive team around you, it can make things a lot harder.

If you do have a supportive team, it can make things a lot more enjoyable.

We may often join other team members' things at the cost of our own.

### The five challenges work in concert

Often the challenges will work in combination.

We can work on all of them at once – by intentionally working on one, we can address the others.

### The five keys to overcoming the air sandwich

Normally we go straight to tools.

BUT the challenge is in following a plan.

Discipline and boundaries are the core to unlocking our best work.

#### The 5 keys are intention, awareness, boundaries, courage and discipline

These are based on Aristotelian ideas, it is important to apply the right key in the right amount.

The air sandwich shows us which doors need to be unlocked – we have 5 keys that can unlock any of the doors.

#### Intention

“Start with the ‘why’”, “Begin with the end in mind”, “Where do you want to be in X years?”.

All of the above are statements of intention.

The theory is that if we know our purpose we are more intentional – and if we don’t, our actions feel random or meaningless.

To make a plan you have to set a goal with intentions.

Plans and goals are intentions about how to use our time.

Many people don’t do their best work because they haven’t set clear intentions especially when zooming down to day planning.

Many suffer because the world does not match their intentions.

A project gives us a focal point to be intentional about how we’re using time, energy and attention.

#### Awareness

Know thyself → calamity comes to those who don’t know who they are.

We should base our plans on what kind of energy and how much time we have.

We need to know what our best work is and how we feel when we’re doing it.

Pay attention to when you are in flow and when stifled, numb or full of dread.

Seeing the challenges and opportunities of the project world allows us to adapt to change rather than crash.

Seeing what’s in the air sandwich helps us to mitigate challenges, you can’t use or beat what you can’t see.

#### Boundaries

Positive and negative boundaries exist.

Positive boundaries create space for something.

Negative boundaries create space from something.

To create a positive boundary we often have to create a negative boundary.

If you don’t set up boundaries for your best work and from the things that keep you from doing it, your best work will be displaced by other things.

Setting up boundaries is hard, but it’s worth it.

#### Courage

Many people lack the courage needed.

Courage is more important than talent – courageous action can build talent but fear keeps us stuck in yesterday.

Every day you choose to do your best work you practice being courageous.

When you identify that a lack of courage is preventing you from doing your best work you can ask questions about how to go forward.

Often it is too easy to play it safe and not push ourselves.

But often the best next step to make progress in our project is the most courageous.

Courage, and the faith it inspires, are the best weapons and armour against when fear lurks.

#### Discipline

We know how much more we’d thrive and be happy if we were disciplined.

Our innate talent, creativity, and drive, combined with discipline, are what make us forces of nature.

Discipline channels our energy into purposeful constructive action.

Without discipline we can be miserable, petty and unfulfilled.

Habits are discipline made automatic.

You have to set boundaries to create routines and stick to them with discipline.

By having the discipline to finish fewer projects, it allows you to finish the fewer ones you have.

The happiest and most successful of creative people are often the most disciplined.

Discipline limits decision fatigue.

Time blocking removes choices about when you’ll do what type of work.

Discipline creates freedom and happiness because it sets the foundation for us to do the things that matter most.

Professionals have the discipline to stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.

### How to use the five keys to overcome the air sandwich

The reality is we often have multiple obstacles applied to multiple projects and must use multiple keys to work through them.

You don’t need every key to make progress.

Which keys are best for which obstacles? See below.

#### Align competing priorities

The result of not acknowledging our priorities and not seeing how our goals and plans end up at odds.

Awareness: Be clear what matters. Claim the priorities and acknowledge them.

Discipline: Keep first things first even when it’s easy to buckle.

Boundaries: Create structure and expectations that limit the influence of other people’s priorities.

#### Take out your head trash

You have to see it for what it is and be able to clear it out.

Awareness: Look for self-defeating beliefs, see what’s real and what’s bullshit.

Courage: Challenge your beliefs and accept choices / co-create your experience.

Discipline: Keep challenging your beliefs, take responsibility for deep change.

#### Remove the No From ‘No Realistic Plan’

Plans create clarity, not certainty.

Awareness: Be aware of what could go wrong, go well or cause you to quit.

Discipline: Keep focussed when Bright Shiny Objects (BSOs) appear.

Intention: Have a specific and useful goal or destination.

#### Overcome too few resources

Learn to be resourceful regardless of how many resources you have.

Awareness: Focus on what you do have.

Discipline: Efficiency requires discipline – how can we better use our resources.

Courage: Be courageous to commit to less. Don’t hedge bets, invest more to succeed.

#### Get your team to work with and for you

An aligned team makes the difference between rowing in circles and having the wind at your back.

Awareness: Be aware of what you really want and be able to communicate it.

Boundaries: Set clear and specific boundaries and structures for the project.

Courage: Be brave enough to take up space, ask for help and stop being the martyr so people will like you.

### Which keys do you need to practice more?

Each individual will have specific keys that they need to practice more than others, based on their personality and life experiences.

People will generally know themselves, which ones they are good at and which ones need more work.

The keys are just habits that you can get better at the more you practice using them.

The keys are both the obstacle and the way to doing your best work.

## Chapter 3: Pick an idea that matters to you

We want to do our best work, but often we avoid doing it.

There is a lot going on in our inner lives and we are often not aware of everything going on in our heart and mind.

Often we tiptoe around our best work, researching, mulling, procrastinating but not making progress on it.

To pick an idea that matters you have to overcome the part of you that wants to play it safe.

You need to embrace the thrashing that you’re doing.

### The more it matters, the more you’ll thrash

Thrashing: Emotional flailing and meta work we do when we don’t fully commit to our best work. Working through head trash, fears, imposter syndrome.

At some level we know, but not why.

Resistance is the head trash, thrashing is the response.

We thrash about things that matter to us.

Many never get beyond thrashing.

The more it matters, the more we thrash because success or failure is deeply important to us.

Every project that matters will involve some thrashing but how we do it is unique

Before we start: Does it even matter?

In the middle: Does anyone care if I finish?

At the end: What will people think.

Through every stage

We often respond by picking an easier task

This happens when a project goes into a void.

Switching won’t make the thrashing go away or it will leave you unsatisfied.

Thrashing isn’t a sign you shouldn’t be doing it, but that you need to push hard to get it done

### Avoiding your best work leads to creative constipation

It will always be challenging so we may avoid it.

Not doing it though means:

You won’t thrive

You won’t want to do projects, set goals, make plans.

This leads to inner toxicity, we feel dark, we lash out at the world and ourselves, becoming resentful, unable to feel positive feelings and get lower and lower over time.

### We are made to slay dragons

“There be dragons” on the journey to thriving.

We often do the easy work but not the best work.

We are the latest in a line of people who have had to go through intense challenges and we have evolved to do that.

Dragons are a signal we are on the right track, we were destined to push through and slay them.

### The gift of failure

Failure in some way is inevitable.

Uncertainty is part of the process.

There are a number of easy to make mistakes.

Yesterday’s failures do not predict the future.

Failure will still sting as it means a lot.

Focusing on what we can do creates motivation.

The better we can learn to manage our minds, rather than react to them, the better we can handle any situation regardless of the level of difficulty.

Each day is a new day to try again.

Failure tells you what you need to hear.

### Displacement is your friend (After it’s your enemy)

Time is our biggest dragon, there is never enough.

The constraint of time adds meaning, this constraint creates displacement

Displacement: Every action we choose to do, displaces countless others we could have done.

Significant, impactful ideas will require at least five years of focussed action to complete.

We have a finite amount of time and whatever we do in that time displaces other things we might do.

With time we will recognise when we are not pursuing our planned projects and the pain of that will motivate us to say ‘no’ to other things

Everything you do displaces something else you could have done.

Work that matters will take a lot of time.

The more you channel energy to one project the faster you’ll finish it.

### To trade up you have to let go

It’s easy for things that don’t matter to end up on your to do list, while stuff that matters ends up waiting till you do the other stuff.

We have to start by filling our time holes with work that does matter.

You must decide from the start that you need to focus on less and let some things go for now.

Letting go of some things is both a mental and emotional activity.

None of us want to walk away from something we have already invested a lot in.

### Five questions to help you sort through what matters most

We learn to do our best work by doing it.

‘Not now’ isn’t the same thing as ‘no’.

Deciding not to work on an idea, frees up energy and focus to intentionally finish and work on another project.

Don’t be afraid to pick the wrong thing as, if you finish it sooner, you can move on.

#### Questions to help you choose the projects that matter most:

If you could pick one thing to celebrate with someone important that you achieved in the last year, what would it be?

What thing would hurt the most if not done?

What thing would you lose sleep over to do?

If done, what would matter the most in five years’ time?

What is worth claiming a significant project slot?

# Part 2: Planning your Project

## Chapter 4: Convert your idea into a project.

Once you choose an idea, you need to convert it to a project you can make space for.

### Convery your idea into a SMART goal

You have to move from having an idea in abstract, to a goal, to avoid long term exhaustion.

You need a goal that is reasonably detailed to have a higher chance of getting done.

A creative person’s SMART goal framework:

Simple
Meaningful
Actionable
Realistic
Trackable

#### Is your goal simple?

You know exactly what you need to do to move it forward.

You don’t have to think about what you need to do to count the goal as done.

A complicated goal made when you’re in the zone may be harder to understand when you’re not.

#### Is your goal meaningful?

You can look at it and quickly understand the importance of completing the goal.

You might not want to do something that’s meaningful, but it still might be meaningful to do.

Doing meaningful work creates fulfilment.

#### Is your goal actionable?

It is actionable if it is immediately clear what action to take to accomplish the goal.

If there is nothing you can do, it is a wish.

The easy way to do this is to begin the phrase with a verb.

#### Is your goal realistic?

You can finish it with the resources you have available.

Creative people see part of reality as tentative.

Just because we can change the way things are, it doesn’t mean we can do it all at once.

Rather than putting your head in the sand, figuring out whether your goal is realistic makes it more likely to succeed.

Drag points: places where your goal is likely to go sideways.

It is important to consider if it is trackable against time.

An unrealistic goal can be made doable when you change your expectation of how long you think it should take.

#### Is your goal trackable?

Is it clear what progress means?

Some goals don’t fit into a temporal framework and are not time-specific but we can actively still do things to make the goal happen e.g. the goal of being a good friend is not time bound.

Most goals are helped with a timeline, to identify action we can take and it makes it feel more real.

Using a quantitative measure will help ensure your plan succeeds e.g. Keep kids from going hungry vs feed 100,000 kids who would otherwise go hungry.

### How to make you goal SMART, step by step

Many creative people struggle with them.

With practice it gets easier.

Verb it: State the goal with a verb.
If you’re stuck use, finish
e.g. Move Alex to Atlanta, Publish a book.

Time it: Think about what seems a good time. Double it.
This will make it realistic.

Check it (against reality):
You may think that it will take less time, but remember you will be working on multiple projects at a time.
Creatives will underestimate how long things take and overestimate how much a goal will be prioritised.

Reread the goal to see if it’s still simple:
A formulaic approach is ok.
e.g. Completion (Verb) (Idea) by (Date)
Move Alex to Atlanta by 1 June.

#### SMART Framework advantages

A quick method to convert an idea to a goal.

You can see related goals and conflicting timelines.

Easy way to communicate your goal to others.

Note: When you convert to a SMART goal emotional reactions are common.

### The three levels of success

Start by assuming you’ll succeed.

Focus on setting up success not preventing failure.

Small success

Minimum requirements, or effort needed, to complete.

Never really proud of them.

Acting on them can lead to greater success.

Still worth celebrating.

Moderate Success

Exceeds minimum requirements for success.

You are likely to be proud of the outcome.

This is the highest level with just your own effort, resources and advantages.

Epic Success

Greatly exceeds the minimum requirements.

Your equivalent of winning the world cup.

It requires you to build a team to achieve.

Considering the level of success while goal setting, it helps you align expectations and resources.

Applying these levels helps lower your anxiety because often we are expecting higher levels without doing the work required.

If you aim small, you can be satisfied when you achieve it.

If you aim epic, when it's hard, you'll know it should be hard to play at this level.

The level is relative to how difficult it is to you and could change over time.

Being clear and specific about the level of success you are aiming for sets you up mentally to be in a good place.

Be careful not to use other people's successes as benchmarks for our own.

Also, we shouldn’t compare ourselves to an idealised version of ourselves, that is a fiction.

Other people's success is irrelevant to you.

Where you are and where you want to go is all that matters and no one but you can set the level of success that matters.

It's important to match the level of success with your level of effort and commitment.

### No date = no finish

If it doesn't have a date, it's not likely to happen.

#### WHY:

Undated items have no real commitment.

Items are usually triaged based on time.

We struggle putting dates on things because we know we will have to make choices to either finish or let go of an existing project.

Dating helps us get real with displacement, and honouring displacement and commitment that we can do what matters most.

It is important to consider start dates in addition to due dates.

There are multiple feelings to setting a start and end date.

The start date should be based on a real reason for delaying starting it.

Are you starting this project today? If not today, when?

### Create your success pack

Steps so far:

SMART Goal

Chosen level of success

Put a start date

Next: Build your success pack, the group of people who will help push you.

Four kinds of people in your success pack:

Guides

Peers

Supporters

Beneficiaries

You'll want 3-5 from each group for projects that will take 3 months or longer.

A person can be in multiple groups especially for supporters and beneficiaries.

Positive groups help and they counter naysayers.

It's the negative people that impact us more.

We should be pruning our yaysayers high.

#### Guides

Serve as people that have reached where you want to go, in a way you want to.

Ideally they are alive and reachable but they may also be historical.

Make sure you don’t create a model that is impossible for you to live up to.

Interactions with guides will be sporadic and sometimes cryptic, but it’s more about their worldview.

You can have imaginary conversations with them, even if you’ve never met them.

#### Peers

People at your approximate level who can regularly contribute to your project.

Guides are in front, peers are side by side with you.

It's good to have peers who can challenge you.

Peers outside your discipline can help give you another perspective.

#### Supporters

People doing work with and for you.

Supporters will do stuff as opposed to guides and peers who are more removed.

Can simply be people who do things for you, so it frees up your time.

Building and curating a support team is important to finishing.

Winning as a team feels good.

It can be difficult to ask for help.

#### Beneficiaries

The people who will benefit from your project.

If you don’t finish, your beneficiaries will be worse off.

There’s no substitute for your best work because no one else will create what you create in the way that you create it.

Being clear about beneficiaries will help keep you going when things get tough.

Be specific about who they are, this can be helpful for motivation and focus.

### Don’t just build your success pack, use it

#### How to turn idea to action

List the 3-5 people in each group.

Name specific people.

For each person, list three ways they can help or you can help them.

Guides: What types of questions to ask them, or who they could introduce you to.

Peers: List skills, connections or perspectives they have.

Supporters: What work can they do to help.

Beneficiaries: List questions you can ask that will show if what you’re doing is helpful.

Determine how often you should talk.

Maybe monthly for peers and beneficiaries.

Weekly for supporters.

Guides are as needed.

Let each person know they are part of the group.

Let them know you’re working on something and want their help.

Communicate with them where they sit.

Proactively communicate with, and show your work to, them.

It’s your job to keep them up to date.

The last step is scary as it’s now not just about you.

It helps make the finishing inevitable though.

## Chapter 5: Make space for your project

Before starting you need to make space.

If you make space for one project you can use that space for the next one.

You should then feel at least some of your time involves making progress on things you really want to.

We struggle in the ways we think about time.

We are better at understanding spatial metaphors, so time and space can be interchangeable.

### Chunking, linking and sequencing: Essential skills to bending time

It’s best to tie time to a particular context.

Generally the context is work.

We work on chunks of projects linked together in the right sequence.

Chunking: Splitting projects into coherent, doable parts.

Linking: Joining chunks together so they hang together.

Sequencing: Linking chunks together into a logical order in space and time.

Chunks need to be verb-nouns.
e.g. book and closet vs read book and clean closet.

A chunk is like a piece of LEGO.

The tops and bottoms of the LEGO are the way we link the chunks together.

At some point in your life you may have started putting random things together with no idea what you were building.

Time is very slippery and has no natural division.

Conventions would say that we have:

year sized chunks

quarter sized chunks

month sized chunks

week sized chunks

day sized chunks

hour sized chunks

minute sized chunks

second sized chunks

Some of those chunks are terrible to plan with, especially smaller chunks.

Better smaller chunks to use are:

15 minutes (called a task)

2 hours (called a block)

Week

Month

Quarter

Year

There is a cost of context and mental switching that is often discounted.

For example each email = 15 min.

2 hours is a good block of time to really get into something while also doing all the normal human activities.

There is an upper limit to how long we can remain fully engaged in something before we experience emotional or cognitive deterioration.

### The project pyramid

Shows how bigger projects contain smaller projects and how smaller chunks tie together.

Shifting timescales can be hard for some.

Some projects require a lot of time and sub-projects, others can be done in a day or a week.

We often set goals that convert into large projects that contain sub-projects, without seeing the weight.

It is a project pyramid because one large project can spawn many sub-projects at lower levels.

The reality is that people grossly underestimate how long things take, take on too many things at once, and then wonder why they feel unproductive.

Time is the ultimate constraint, we can’t bend it, expand it, manage it or alter it, we can only work within the constraint.

If you can’t perceive the size and issues of an overall project, you can reduce the excess that’s making things harder.

### How common project words tie together

Observations

Verbs give an indication to how big a chunk is.

Certain verbs follow and contain others.

Some chunks go with others, some go in others.

With verb-noun combinations, the noun stays constant and the verb changes through the sequence and the verb also gives us an idea of the size.
eg. Hire Skyler, becomes:
Research Skyler → Email → Interview → Evaluate → Decide on → Hire

There are common words that are used everywhere and that can be correlated to specific size chunks.

The following lists link time periods to verbs:

Quarter or month: Rework, Develop, Strategize, Launch/Ship, Build, Publish (Books, articles), Kick Off, Move / Relocate.

Week (1-5, 2 hour blocks): Research, Decide on, Collaborate with, Create, Plan, Design, Analyse/evaluate, Coordinate, Promote, Edit, Apply.

Task (15 minutes): Email, Call, Sort, Read, Send, Check, Review, Find, Compile, Schedule, Make, Text, Fax, Mail, Print.

Examples of turning bigger projects into simplified chunk sequences:

Moving to a new city:

Research places → decide on places → plan moving schedule → sell or get rid of stuff → pack stuff → move stuff → unpack stuff.

Starting a new business:

Research business ideas → decide on model → make a business plan → design product → create product → promote product → deliver product.

Publish a book:

Brainstorm book ideas → decide on book idea → create an outline → draft manuscript → collaborate with editor → edit manuscript → create a marketing plan → promote book.

Getting a degree:

Evaluate degree options → decide on degree options → research universities → apply to universities → evaluate university offers → plan move to university → collaborate with advisor on course schedule → decide on courses → take courses.

5. Developing a Fundraiser:

Evaluate fundraising needs → decide on fundraising strategy → plan fundraising campaign → coordinate with fundraisers → promote campaign.

### The five projects rule

Most people won’t complete more than five total projects per timescale.

In practice, three projects is a better limit for professional and creative projects as it leaves bandwidth for “life” projects.

Active projects are ones on your metaphorical desktop.

The five project rule is simple, but can be difficult to practice, but remember your 3-5 projects may contain sub-projects depending on the scale.

At each time scale you have, different elements of 5 weekly projects that should be chunks of monthly projects.

Example:
This month:

Draft chapters

Launch momentum planners

Present

This week:

Draft Ch6

Prep workshop CLP

Attend GLP

Finish proposal for Marclent

Today:

Draft Ch6

Finish proposal

Meet client

At the week level the above is sufficient. Fixed times for everything are on a calendar.

At the daily level you don’t need to specify when you’re doing the work, that’s done by the week block schedule.

Admin blocks are captured in work management software.

When making next week, the weekly plan is updated.

If being truthful about days, weeks, months you may see that 50–75% of time is already committed to recurring stuff so you may only be able to commit to one or two project slots.

If you can, list the steps to do something you can delegate recurring work.

Using the five project rule allows you to work from a smaller, more focused list rather than handing the ‘To-Do list of Doom’.

The five project rule is the outset of processing the dumped action items.

Trying to drive your momentum from your dumping ground is like having to dig through laundry baskets every time you need to dress, without knowing which laundry basket is clean and which is dirty. Sure you can do it but you’re setting yourself up for crazy-making.

Mastering quarter-sized projects is key.

Once we accept constraints, we can use what we have to finish things.

### Convert your weekly schedule into coherent blocks

If you don’t create open work blocks in your week, or use them, you’re not going to get any momentum.

The weekly perspective is the longest level people feel comfortable planning.

It is more clear of all of the constraints we have to achieve our goals at the weekly level.

At the monthly level, those constraints are not obvious at the daily level magical thinking happens.

The weekly perspective is best for building schedules to more coherent and purposeful blocks.

#### Four basic blocks

Focus: 90–120 minutes – creative, inspired, high level

Social: 90–120 minutes – ready to meet other people

Admin: 30–60 minutes– low energy, not in the zone

Recovery: Variable – activities that recharge us

These time ranges includes time for breaks.

#### Focus blocks

Most people have a hard time creating more than 3 per day.

You can get a lot done with 3 per day.

Most people don’t have a free focus block to work on projects they want to.

You don’t get to do your kinds of work, you don’t get to do as much of the work you want to do because you have a lot more of the work you don’t want to do.

Focus blocks fuel your best work.

No or too few focus blocks = No finishing.

Anything over 10 hours is hard to deal with.

5 blocks is easier to visualise the chunks we can do in that amount of time.

This is an issue that you may find when putting off a bigger project because you don’t know how to get started or how much time it would take.

Spending 20h over a month is overwhelming, doing a creative block a day isn’t.

Consistent progress is better than fits and starts. Resist the urge to do long creative pushes that result in you feeling depleted and sluggish.

The number of focus blocks you have is your limiting factor to progress.

Many people misdiagnose their struggles as procrastination, lack of capability or lack of creativity.

The root cause is you don’t have enough focus blocks.

#### Social blocks

Time to interact with people in real time.

Real time collaboration is a hybrid block but better to group them as a social block.

The time you spend with friends, family, colleagues is valuable.

Real time service hours are social blocks.

Social blocks make good bookends to other blocks as we tend to honour our commitments to other people more than we do to ourselves.

When in flow it’s easy to bleed a focus block into the next block of time, but this leaves us creatively winded.

#### Admin blocks

This is for things like email, phone calls, filing and low-level editing.

Also for organising projects and formatting.

Usually stuff you don’t want to do.

Admin blocks give you time to reflect on your work.

Knowing you have admin blocks allows you to stress less about all the work you need to do.

Often we spend our day rolling from admin block to admin block until we don’t have the energy for focus time.

We feel we need to attend to the admin work that is seen as urgent, and then we can do the fun stuff.

If you find you are making good progress on admin tasks but not on the work you really want to do. The admin work is biting into deeper values and goals that are more important to you than your best work.

Admin blocks are 30–60 min because once you go into Admin mode you might as well stay there even though each task is around 15 minutes.

It’s too unwieldy to plan 15 min at a time.

In admin blocks you batch tasks together.

Batching: lumping the same kind of work together.

#### Recovery blocks

Focus, social, admin = output

We need to be more intentional about recovery blocks than other blocks, as we are overfocused on output.

Recovery blocks keep poor health, illness and pain at bay.

Everybody is different and it’s more important what the activity does for you.

You can use your dead blocks for recovery.

Recovery blocks can be good follow-ups to focus blocks.

Plan on a recovery block for every two focus or social blocks.

### Do you need to rename some blocks?

Generally, you can categorise every life activity into one of these four blocks.

You may find that you have a chores block or a family block.

Having too many kinds of blocks creates too much to juggle.

People often under prioritise their personal life and so you can and possibly should apply this approach to both work and personal life.

You still need recovery blocks at work.

### Three focus blocks per week avoids a thrash

Focus blocks are the fuel for your best work and create anchors for your schedule.

Once you have a weekly schedule around your focus blocks, with clear boundaries, you’ll be able to see where 2-hour blocks can be put.

When you have your schedule to minimise the holes you will have to be clear what existing projects you have.

As a minimum you will need 3 focus blocks per week to keep momentum.

If it is a struggle, better to finish an existing project first.

Avoid filling up new found focus blocks with another distracting project.

Applying the five project rule and weekly blocks, you can create more space with the snowball method.

Snowball method: Finish the project that you can get done the fastest, then use its focus block to the next fastest to finish.

Three focus blocks is important during the void phase of thrashing.

You can still make progress with less, you just may get frustrated.

### It’s time to make time

Don’t let the simplicity of the five project rule with focus blocks and weekly planning belie its power. Simple doesn’t mean easy.

It can be as simple as two pieces of paper and a pencil to figure out 5 projects for this quarter, month, and week.

## Chapter 6: Build your project roadmap

After creating space and creating a schedule, you need to break your project into chunks.

Building a project roadmap is a special kind of project plan that chunks, links and sequences over time.

The roadmap puts chunks to today and this week.

### Open ‘Flow’ with your project by building your GATES

Some people don’t play to their strengths when choosing a project.

If you play to your strengths, flow is easier.

You should base your project on GATES:

Genius: An expression of inner creative force.

Affinity: What you’re drawn to do.

Talents: Your native skills or capabilities.

Expertise: What you’ve learned in your life.

Strengths: What comes easy to you.

Always ask: ‘Which of my GATES can I leverage to complete this project?’

One approach is to have a three-column diagram. The first is gates, the second, methods, the third, goals.

Once you are clear on your GATES and you know your goal, you can work out your best methods and figure out the best pathway.

We use less energy when we use our GATES to solve problems rather than try to brute force the problem.

### Build a budget for your project

Most projects require some money or if they don’t, it can make them easier.

The less we have the more likely we are to compensate by spending money we don’t need. But the more money we have the more likely we are to continue our expenses and still feel like we don’t have enough.

Budgeting for your project creates a positioning boundary for your work.

Making budgets is like making plans, it’s an awareness-generating process.

Being clear about how money can improve the project, helps you look for ways to solve problems.

Common items in a budget:

Professional support: paying someone to do something you don’t need to do.

Tools and apps: Buying or renting tools to get the job done.

Personal support: Care, gardening, house cleaning.

Lodging, offices: Places to get work done.

Food: Getting food made for you, to save time.

When you have aggregated your expenses compare that to the baseline.

Discuss your budget with others, they might help.

Think about the cost of not doing it.

### Deadlines guide your project, Capacity drives your project

It’s not about setting deadlines that get results, it’s doing the work.

If you don’t have the blocks of time set aside over a period of time, it won’t happen.

Setting a deadline and then working backwards is called backward planning.

Backward planning is good for hard deadlines but doesn’t work well for a lot of creative people.

It’s easy to build a plan that is not realistic as we fail to consider other projects we have going on at the same time, so plans are doomed before you finish.

Projects that matter to us often don’t have hard deadlines. They are not urgent, little pressure and are generally more nebulous. We might create aspirational deadlines but they are “good to do by” dates.

Building from capacity rather than deadline gets us closer to doing the number of projects we actually finish.

We have less planning, adjusting, team collisions and less frustration.

Basing plans on capacity helps shift your focus from results to process.

#### Backward planning is useful for:

Constraining the size of the project.

Illuminating milestones and deadlines.

Hitting deadlines anchored to dates.

If backward planning works for you use it, but adjust deadlines based on what you can actually do.

This may mean you need to drop other projects to get it done in time.

Intentionally dropping projects to finish a project that matters is better than not doing that and doing too many projects.

### Don’t forget to account for relay time

Relay time is the waiting time that happens every time a project changes hands.

If you have a sequential project or one that requires someone else to review or approve the project can be stuck waiting.

You need to be clear about what you need, communicate in ways so the message is received, make it clear it is a relay task and who to hand it to next.

Don’t say ‘thoughts?’, or ‘what do you think?’ when asking for feedback, be as specific as you can.

Essentially you just need to consider relay time.

### How to build your project roadmap?

Some rules:

If writing, use pencil

Make multiple passes.

Have a messy and a clean area.

A top-down or bottom-up approach is ok.

Expect it to be messy & imperfect.

STEPS:

Start a chunk list

All the top of mind parts of the project should be recorded.

The size of the chunks and approach doesn’t matter, just get them down.

Sort and link your chunks

Organise and see how things link together.

You can if you want to, split into a hierarchy from quarter size to week size chunks but only if you’re strong at spatial thinking.

Sequence your chunks

Look at how the verbs in front of the chunks relate to each other.
e.g. Research > Plan > Create > Edit > Publish.

You’ll often notice missed chunks.

You may need to rename chunks.

Try not to get into scheduling yet.

Clump your chunks

Organise smaller chunks by the larger chunks that contain them.

Using the project-pyramid as a guide, it helps decide how to clump.

Clumping allows us to switch to a higher level time perspective.

Most projects that matter will span over months and quarters.

We don’t need to see lower level chunks at those higher levels.

Upgrade your clumps

After creating larger clumps check if you need to upgrade some clumps to the next larger size.

Upgrade your chunks, based on the  triggers below: (5 triggers)

You have no idea how long it will take.

You’re not competent at the work involved.

Someone else needs to complete the chunk.

The clump has more than five chunks.

One of the chunks in the clump will take longer than the size of the clump.

#### Overlay your chunks on a timeline

As part of the upgrading, you need to check the sequence is coherent and logical.

To begin, you have to start with the time perspective that relates to the perspective of your project.

Use a timeline that is one size larger than your largest chunk.

If you want to use a focus block timeline, it should be no larger than a monthly timeline.

Road mapping this way makes it easier to adjust large chunks rather than changing dates of a lot of tasks or blocks.

Also, you can transpose other projects to the same timeline.

With the project pyramid, you don’t have to know in advance what all the moving pieces are.

When it’s time to get working, you can activate the chunks relevant to that time perspective.

#### Schedule your chunks

Putting something on a timeline and scheduling are not the same thing.

Saying you will do something tomorrow is not the same as committing to a specific block of time.

Your scheduling approach comes down to the tools you use.

Scheduling with a standard diary type tool, it can be harder to show where you’re committed to a month-sized project. Blocks can become appointments in a calendar.

Don’t schedule chunks too far in advance.

With the project pyramid approach, you’re doing monthly planning, so should only be scheduling or prioritising at that perspective, which means looking at the quarter for context and scheduling week-sized chunks.

For weekly planning, look at the month for context and schedule blocks for next week.

The further out you schedule creative projects, the more likely you’ll need to adjust.

The less advance planning you do, the less likely you are to complete it. It’s a balancing act.

## Chapter 7: Keep flying by accounting for drag points

Reality will push against your planning.

The person most likely to push against it is you.

### Your no-win scenarios are keeping you from flying

#### The “success will wreck my relationships” tale:

It’s easy to create a story that says “if I win, I hurt someone.”

Sometimes people crowd out success consciously or unconsciously because of their own insecurities.

Too many people don’t allow themselves, or get, to be the stars in their own story.

To succeed you need to practice intention, boundaries, and courageous hard conversations.

#### The success vs virtue myth:

The starving artist myth says how creativity ≠ financial success and if you do make money, you’ve “sold out.”

The nice guys finish last myth says it’s better to keep your character and not win, rather than sacrificing who you are.

The rich people are bad myth says you must have cheated, stolen, been bad to get there.

Success is pitted against virtue.

#### Reframing the tension:

Find a model of someone who has become successful and virtuous.

What virtues are at risk and how might you sacrifice them?

How could winning make you more virtuous?

#### What if I can’t do it again trap:

If we really give things our ‘all’ and are seen for what we can do, we will set a high standard we may not be able to do again, is one way people think.

So we don’t give it our all.

The tricky part here is there is a fear of losing the fun and freedom of dabbling.

The thing is, we have to work hard past the point of fun to accomplish and master our crafts.

We should assume that over time we will improve.

So the current version of yourself may not be able to do it again, but the experienced version of you, will.

It’s better to try something with all your heart that might not work than continue to go for easy wins.

### Transcend the safe play of mediocrity

Some people in your life will push you out of failure but few will push you beyond mediocrity.

In the long run, choosing mediocrity is the worst thing for you to thrive in your life and your career.

We don’t overcome no-win scenarios by being mediocre but by rejecting the stories that create them.

### Don’t be owned by OPP (Other People’s Problems)

Our priorities exist alongside other people’s priorities and other projects.

If we accept OPP as our own, they become competing priorities.

Many base their life around OPP which leads to burnout and compensation.

The longer the project takes, the more OPP.

The more important the project is to you, the more OPP.

OPP never goes away.

If you aren’t clear about your priorities with yourself and other people, you’ll continually have OPP around.

The more you bend and accommodate OPP, the more you’ll have to bend and accommodate OPP.

You have to have clear boundaries.

Make time for OPP you want to do by scheduling it.

For things you don’t accept, make it a NO, not maybe.

You may need to not talk about your project to avoid OPP.

You can potentially weave OPP into your project; you should always check to see if that’s possible.

Sometimes involving a person may be better than keeping them on the sideline.

### Derailers and naysayers

Things working against you = the status quo.

The more your project challenges the status quo, the more likely you will have derailers and naysayers.

Derailers are sometimes well-meaning.

Naysayers are actively against you.

#### How to handle derailers:

They think they’re trying to help.

How to interact with them:

Ask them if they want you to be successful with the project.

Ask them how you would like feedback.

If they keep derailing, remind them again.

If they still do it, be more strategic.

Still doing it? Go covert and try not to talk about it to them.

#### How to deal with naysayers:

It’s the nature of a naysayer to naysay.

A naysayer will rarely contribute to success.

Be aware of ghost naysayers (not a real person)—past naysayers are ghost naysayers, these are just head trash.

How do you deal with them?

Don’t engage with them.

Don’t change your project to make them happy.

If you have an urge to engage with them, engage with a yaysayer.

If they stop naysaying, do not think they are now in your success pack.

Every bit of energy you use dealing with a naysayer is better spent working on your project.

### How to do a project pre-mortem

The process of considering all the ways a project might go bad, to actively prevent those problems.

#### Questions to ask:

Have you created any no-win scenarios? How can you detangle them?

Is your method hard for you? Start from leveraging your GATES.

What OPP do you need to account for?

How might you align OPP with your project?

Are there any derailers and naysayers to account for? List them and how to address them.

Are there any projects you can let go of to keep them from bogging you down?

Are there any bad or unhelpful stories you’re telling yourself? How will you counteract them?

You will probably have emotional reactions to these questions. That’s ok. You may need to let them sit for a while.

# Part 3: Working the plan

## Chapter 8: Weave your project into your schedule

The weekly block schedule, the five project rule, and the project roadmap together create a plan and addressing drag points helps you use the space.

You have to weave projects into your life schedule but reality will always interfere.

When plans and reality don’t match, you need to adjust your plans.

Momentum planning: The continual process of making and adjusting plans across all time perspectives.

### Make sure your environment is working for you

Your environment is very important for focus, momentum and creativity.

Are you actively creating the space to do your best work?

You need your own “lab” to create an environment that feels frictionless.

These are the factors:

Sound: Figure out what background sound works.

Smell: Can have a powerful impact on us.

Sunlight: The amount effects our moods.

Clothing: What you wear is part of your environment.

Clutter: Tolerance for clutter or tidiness.

Amount of space: Size and things in the room.

Music: Individual choices impact our moods.

What works is very much a personal thing.

You may find going to a coffee shop or library helps you concentrate and be at your best.

### Batching and stacking work increases your efficiency

Batching: Doing similar kinds of work in an uninterrupted and continuous period of time.

Stacking: Doing dissimilar kinds of work in the same stretch of time.

Batching is already easily mixed with in admin blocks.

Batching minimises context switching.

Stacking is not multi-tasking or rapid refocusing.

A day of clicking is rarely a day of getting your best work done.

What distinguishes stacking from batching is that it uses different kinds of physical and mental resources simultaneously. e.g. Doing laundry while listening to an audiobook or doing an audio meeting while hiking.

What doesn’t work well is doing different mental or physical focus activities at the same time e.g. email and deep writing, or a focussed conversation while reading.

Stop doing inefficient multitasking.

Think about what you can do well simultaneously.

### Keep the dread-to-work ratio down by dealing with the frogs earlier and every day

Frogs: Things we really don’t want to do.

Mark Twain said: “If you know you have to swallow a frog, swallow it first thing in the morning. If there are two frogs, swallow the big one first.”

The dread-to-work ratio explained:

Most tasks require a fixed minimum amount of work, as in doing them later won’t make them easier.

It’s the dread that increases with time.

It costs you resources to spend the time fretting while you’re not doing it.

A frog a day keeps your anchors aweigh.

Some frogs require a focus block.

Be honest about whether you’re not eating them because you have to have a plan or because you don’t want to catch them.

Identify your frogs and catch at least 1 per day, if you do this:

You keep your dread to work ratio low.

You get fewer and smaller frogs, as in you will see patterns and eliminate them appearing in the first place.

You reclaim energy, not thinking about them.

You will always have frogs that need addressing

### When before what

There are better and worse times during the day, or year, to work on projects.

But it’s a trap to keep waiting and believe you need an ideal schedule to make progress.

Timing can remove some barriers that make progress harder.

#### Time of day

There are considered 3 chronotypes
1. Early birds/larks 2. Night owls 3. Afternoon Emus

This can change with age.

It’s often better to shift your schedule to match your chronotype.

Our societal systems work on the assumption that we are larks without the chance to see if we’re not.

People don’t know your schedule and will assume you have other commitments if you shift things around to match your chronotype.

Set your focus blocks as the default that others need to work around.

#### Day of the week

Some days of the week may be better to do certain kinds of work than other days.

Put work that requires the most effort on days you have the most creative, positive energy. In general this is Mon, Tue when you will have the most focused energy.

Batch follow up and collaborative work for days more people are available. Generally this is Tue–Thu not Mon and Fri.

Schedule lighter (e.g. relationship, rapport and review meetings) on Thu and Fri.

There’s no reason you can’t claim parts or all of Sat and Sun for your best work.

You need to make sure you remember to schedule time to rest.

With some weekly schedule organisation, you can stop being resigned at the end of the week or anxious that you are behind at the start of the week.

You can also factor in times of the year.

#### First things first isn’t necessarily about sequence

It means doing your most important things first rather than filling up your time with less important stuff.

But first in priority does not mean first in sequence.

Sometimes you have to wait for the right timing to get the high priority task done, due to your chronotype or other factors.

### When to do your momentum planning

The best time to create a plan is when you realise you don’t have one.

Regardless of the time of day, stop scrambling for 15min or an hour to plan.

For frequency, once a week create your weekly plan, once a day your daily plan.

These are suggested approaches:

Daily: The night before or first thing before email, this prevents you taking on OPP (<15 min)

Weekly: Sunday night or first thing Monday before email (<30 min)

Monthly: The weekend before the month starts or first Monday of the month. This may require a focus block.

Quarterly: The weekend before the quarter starts. You can take multiple passes over this.

Annual: The month before the year starts. This may take multiple passes to get it right.

It is easier to do lower level plan planning when you’ve done higher level planning first.

### Use the 5/10/15 split to build daily momentum

This combines the 5 project rule with momentum planning.

Unless you’re good at planning your day, it’s really hard to do it first thing in the morning.

It’s easier to check email and get distracted with OPP and this repeats a bad pattern.

5 = Five Projects Rule (5PR)

10 = 10 minute check-in

15 = 15 minute check-in

#### The 15 minute Checkout

We usually have a better perspective at the end of the day than at the beginning.

3 Questions to ask at the end of the day:

What did you accomplish? (Celebrate!)

Always celebrate what you achieved!

If you don’t celebrate small wins it’s harder to build momentum to big ones.

Is there anything to do, to be able to disengage, before you finish for the day?

Check your inbox / to do, for things that have to happen

What would really happen if you didn’t do it now?

When do you need to do things you didn’t do today?

A bunch of things that need to get done soon but not today.

Make a note/plan so you’ll see it tomorrow.

#### The 10 minute Check-in

3 Questions to ask at the start of the day:

Has anything changed between now and when you did your checkout?

Some events require you to change plans.

What did you plan for today?

Review the plan you made the day before.

What one thing will you do right now?

Focus on one thing for your next block.

Better to make progress on 1 than shuffle 3.

Be wary of checking email and Teams, ask yourself what’s there that would change your day?

Plan how you’re going to process your email and Teams as in, looking for the messages for right now rather than just jumping into email.

### Don’t plan out too far in advance

Planning too far out avoids doing the work today.

Some of us like the puzzle solving in the planning.

But not planning out far enough in advance can lead to being unprepared.

Assuming you’ve accounted for deadlines at the monthly level of planning, four weeks is about as far out as you can reasonably plan daily blocks with any degree of confidence.

In this context planning really means the details of daily planning

With practice you’ll find the Goldilocks level of advance planning.

### How to do your first round of momentum planning

The hardest part is the first round.

How to start from scratch?

Start with the month level perspective.

Review and capture deadlines or major events.

Month level events that will disrupt your routine e.g. presentation, wedding, travel, moving.

You have hard constraints on your schedule that constrain how many blocks you have.

If you have a good picture of your five projects for the quarter, review, adjust and capture them.

The five projects give you context for the month

Decide what your five projects for the month need to be.

The five project rule, means no more than five per time scale, but you may not be able to fill all the slots.

It may be helpful to review an action verbs list at this point.

Chunk five projects into week size chunks.

Some projects may not need a full month

Once you’ve started with month level perspective you can zoom up to a larger perspective of time.

Give yourself a focus block to make the momentum plan for the month.

## Chapter 9: Build daily momentum

It’s the accumulation of purposeful and productive days that lead to finishing.

But daily we have distractions, interruptions and the consequences of decisions we’ve made.

It’s easy to get away from us on a single day which can stack up over time.

Celebrate small wins so you can celebrate bigger ones

Best work requires long projects and with setbacks it can be easy to lose track of the big picture.

Every block of time moves you closer.

Finishing is important but progress matters too, as you do finish one project, it will then become the start of the next project.

At a certain point the joy is in the process and progress, not the product.

This means all the smaller chunks we finish every day are worth celebrating.

Celebrate: taking a moment to acknowledge you showed up in the middle of the chaos of life, you finished something that mattered.

We should flip daily self deprecation, to daily celebrations, and counter the negative stories we otherwise tend to reinforce.

#### How to celebrate small wins:

Create a win journal to highlight 3 wins per day.

Account for wins late in the day, so you go to sleep anchoring your wins for better sleep, rather than going to bed with frustrations or setbacks in mind.

Share small wins with other people.

Keep a project/streak tracker

Can be evidence to yourself you can do what you set your mind to.

Celebrating small wins shifts the language and mindset around big wins.

You have big wins when you’ve been celebrating and keeping up with all the small wins along the way.

Create habits and routines that make it easier to build and maintain momentum

These are automatic behaviours that reduce the energy needed to do.

We all create defaults, but the ones we naturally create don’t necessarily help us.

The more frequently we do something, the more likely we are to do it next time.

How do we create and maintain defaults that work for us? Minimise ones that work against us.

Habits

Behaviours so ingrained that they are hard to stop.

Anchors are habits focussed around environments and tools.

Since we know things happen around places and tools we can choose to build habits around places.

Try not to mix the environment or tool for different things.

Routines

Habits or behaviours consistently done in the same sequence or at the same time.

You just need to start the routine to complete the sequence.

Routines create flow.

Types of Routines:

Bedtime routines: a series of steps that helps you wind down and sleep easier.

Work warmup routines: consider the first five actions you do, perhaps checking email should be the last. If you work from home, having something that separates work from personal life can be helpful.

Work checkout routines: The 15 in 5/10/15 could be part of it, as well as organising your desk, making sure things are saved etc.

Afterwork routines: This could be putting your personal belongings in certain places when you get home, setting out your gym clothes or meditation, exercising, or if at home, something to create a buffer between work and home.

Cold-start routines: a list of things you do to get back in the groove after a break.

Chore routines: a way to almost automatically get chores done by following a certain order can make life easier.

You can build on existing habits by habit stacking. Habit staking is attaching a new habit to an existing one.

Leave yourself a crumb trail

It’s usually easy to tell the next step at the end of a working session.

It can be hard to know the next step at the start of the working session.

Leaving a crumb trail (Hansel and Gretel style) makes it easier to follow where you left off.

We need to leave ourselves enough time at the end of a focus block to create a crumb trail.

Realising that the momentum we have at the end of a focus block won’t be there at the start of the next is important to make the time to do it.

Too often we use all the available time to finish and move to something else without creating one.

Once you assume you’ll struggle to restart and create breadcrumbs you don’t struggle.

Ways to leave breadcrumbs:

At the end of a session leave yourself a quick note about where to pick up.

If you don’t do it at the end of the focus block, at least do it at the end of the day.

Consider stopping before you’re empty and leaving something easy to start with.

On hold and stuck projects, should have breadcrumbs as well.

Minimise interruptions and distractions

Interruptions are external diversions e.g. kids, calls, coworkers.

Distractions are internal diversions we allow ourselves to do e.g. email, social media, YouTube, magazines, news etc.

Focusing on the entry point prevents interruption or distraction.

Interrupting interruptions

Hardest to deal with as they are other people.

Being mostly uninterruptible is sometimes called going dark which could be for focus or recovery blocks.

Going dark may require discussion with:

Bosses: Can be the hardest, frame your need to do more and better work.

Coworkers: Having commonly available times dislodges the always available mindset.

Adult(ish) Family: It’s about bartering  for free/dark time and having an agreed approach.

Children, friends, clients and neighbours can also be distractions.

Entry points to close: phone, email, Teams, door, switch environments, shut down apps.

Dealing with distractions

There is the Infinite Loop of Digital Distractions known as the Loop

The reality is it is very easy to get stuck in the loop and not achieve the things you planned to.

We get in the loop where the combination of microgoal completion and dopamine keep us on it. It seems as if we’re getting somewhere but there’s lots of movement with no progress.

The harder it is to distract yourself the less likely you are to be distracted.

Some strategies:

Make your daily momentum plan before getting into things like email.

Create better defaults during transitions, e.g. walk around rather than check email.

Turn off all notifications, ensuring you have admin blocks to keep up with email, Teams etc.

Lock yourself out, use apps to block certain things if they are too tempting.

Delete apps that distract you.

Use dumb tech with no internet capability if you are still really struggling.

Eliminating distractions alone can generate the recommended three focus blocks per week to fuel your best work.

We ultimately choose to be distracted and that is preventing us from doing things we want to do.

Cascades, tarpits and logjams

Projects get stuck or slip for different reasons

There are common pitfalls.

Cascades:

Where one project gets behind and causes others to get behind.

You can help this situation by:

Putting all optional projects on hold.

Saying no to new projects where you can.

Sorting your remaining projects by importance.

Working on projects sequentially.

Following the five project rule.

Logjams:

When you have too many parallel projects happening at once and you can’t finish them all when you need to.

You can help this situation by:

Reviewing the conflicting projects to determine which chunks will get it moving.

Triage projects and renegotiate deadlines if you can.

Anticipate and address logjams before they happen.

Tarpits

A project gets stuck and the longer it gets stuck the harder it is to restart.

You can help this situation with the following sequence:

Make sure it’s not dead.

Reconnect with the pain of not doing it.

Chunk the project into smaller pieces.

Pick a chunk you can do in the next 3 days.

Work on a chunk at least twice a week.

Avoid putting it into a closet.

If you keep hitting tarpits, reduce the number of projects you have.

### How to get through the creative red zone

The last stretch to finishing can be called the red zone, like in American Football, where players often fumble just before the line.

Towards the end we are often tired or exasperated so we fall into overthinking or succumb to creative fatigue.

What can we do?

Double down by returning to the ‘why’ of the project.

Remember the world is a little better because of what we’re doing.

Remember, when you’re finished, you’ll have one more thing that matters, done, and you can be proud of your creation.

Focus on getting it to good enough, not perfect.

Remember perfection is the enemy of good.

Know that the more it matters…

the more it’s only a start away.

the better it is that we start finishing sooner.

Understand that toward the end you’re usually working on your own mindset

Often in the red zone we’re continuing to work but we’re not really getting anywhere.

Do your work then step away.

It might be better to get it done and celebrate, and be proud that you finished.

## Chapter 10: Finish strong

Rather than just jumping to the next thing you should bask in your success.

### Run a victory lap

A regular feature of sports and other high-pressure events is a victory lap.

When we make or achieve something significant we want to show it and be seen for making or achieving it.

Sometimes the most important job of your success pack isn’t to help you get to the finish line but to help you reflect and amplify your success.

The victory lap deserves to be part of your post-finish process just as much as anything else does.

#### Ways to do it:

Let your success pack know when you’ve finished your project.

When appropriate, make it a staple response to “what’s going on?”, to talk about your success.

Create a milestone moment, such as a dinner, concert, or something out to celebrate.

### Make space and time to transition between projects

The more it matters to you, the greater need for downtime and transition time after finishing your project.

People have a tendency to move straight on to the next project.

The void that follows the completion of a project can be unsettling.

There may be a bunch of things that have been neglected you need to catch up on.

It’s good to plan for downtime at the end.

#### Some questions:

What low-energy projects or tasks would either feel good to work through or relieve unnecessary pressure?

Who are the people you would like to catch up with now the project is done?

Do you have activities you would like to catch up on now you have more time?

### Give yourself time to some CAT work – Clean up, Archive and Trash

During a project you can end up with quite a digital mess.

Cleanup: Make sense of what’s around you.

Environmental: Your work environment, cleanup and maintenance on tools, replacing or restocking items used.

Digital: Make sense of all the links, working files and things on your desktop used during the project.

Social: Pick up conversations, make your thank yous to those who helped.

Archive: Decide what things are worth keeping and what’s not, you want to organise things to make them easier to find later.

Environmental: Putting things back where it’s supposed to be, re-organising or storing stuff that’s not being used.

Digital: Put things out of the way, and do it’s easy to find them later. You don’t need multiple versions of the same file.

Trash: Recycling, donating or throwing something away.

Environmental: Physical stuff that be gotten rid of.

Digital: Delete your no longer needed digital files, after they are backed up.

Better to tidy things up when we plan to rather than when we have to.

After action reviews make your next project easier, better and more fun

Ask the following questions:

What went well? (People, processes and tools that made the project go well).

What setbacks, challenges, or missteps did I experience?

What did I learn?

What habits, practices or routines do I want to keep doing going forward?

Were there any especially important decision makers for the project?

Capture the above and review the answers at the start of your next major project.

### You have unlocked new possibilities by finishing your project

You have overcome many obstacles on your way to completing your project.

Every significant project you finish leaves more of your fingerprint on the universe.

The finish of one project is just the start of many others.

Completing your project may have unlocked new: Projects, GATES, Communities, Mindset and stories or things for your portfolio.

You’re doing the work to make your story.

But don’t expect things to change much when you finish, it’s all about the process and the practice.
